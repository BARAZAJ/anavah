                <p>Growing up, I was deeply moved by the struggles and injustices faced by marginalized communities. I saw how lack of access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities trapped individuals in cycles of poverty and despair. I knew I had to do something to make a difference.</p>

                <p> My passion for this cause was ignited during my volunteer work at a local community centre, where I witnessed first-hand the impact of dedicated support and resources on people's lives. I saw children blossom into confident learners, women gain economic independence, and elderly individuals find dignity and purpose.</p>
                <p> Anavah Foundation is born out of this passion and commitment. </p>
